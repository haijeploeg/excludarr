# Excludarr
By default there is no option to exclude streaming providers from the automatically imported movies throught lists in Radarr. I have created 2 basic API wrappers to connect to Radarr and TMDB (the available API wrappers did not work). This script will do the following:
1. Get a full overview of movies.
2. Extract the tmdbid value of each movie found.
3. Lookup the extracted `tmdbid` value from Radarr at TMDB itself and check if the movie is available on one of the chosen providers in your country.
4. All movie ids (database ids from Radarr) that are available on one of the chosen streaming services will be deleted and excluded from auto import in the future.

## Dependencies
- Python3
- Radarr v3 (latest)
- TMDB account (Free)

## Installation
```bash
pip install excludarr
```

## Configuration
To configure the application make sure that one of the following files exists:

```
/etc/excludarr/excludarr.yml
~/.config/excludarr/excludarr.yml
~/.excludarr/config/excludarr.yml
~/.excludarr.yml
./.excludarr.yml
```

The application will read those configuration files in that order. So `./.excludarr.yml` will overwrite `/etc/excludarr/excludarr.yml`. For a full list of options and their description see `.excludarr-example.yml` in this repository.

## How to use
Make sure you have setup the configuration file correctly. Read the help page carefully. By default the tool will never delete anything without the `--force` flag specified.

To delete movies you can execute the following:
```bash
$ excludarr exclude -t radarr -a delete
┏━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━━┓
┃ ID  ┃ Title                                  ┃ Providers ┃
┡━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━━━┩

│ 17  │ Bad Boys for Life                      │ netflix   │
│ 18  │ The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge on the Run │ netflix   │
└─────┴────────────────────────────────────────┴───────────┘
Are you sure you want to change the status of the movies to: delete? (y/N) y
```

To only change the status to not monitored in radarr:
```bash
$ excludarr exclude -t radarr -a not-monitored
┏━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━━┓
┃ ID  ┃ Title                                  ┃ Providers ┃
┡━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━━━┩
│ 8   │ Outside the Wire                       │ netflix   │
│ 12  │ We Can Be Heroes                       │ netflix   │
│ 13  │ Jumanji: The Next Level                │ netflix   │
│ 17  │ Bad Boys for Life                      │ netflix   │
│ 18  │ The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge on the Run │ netflix   │
└─────┴────────────────────────────────────────┴───────────┘
Are you sure you want to change the status of the movies to: not-monitored? (y/N) y
```

The exclude command also works with Sonarr! Just change the `-t radarr` to `-t sonarr`. This only works using the exclude command, the check command is not compatible with sonarr yet.

To check the "not-monitored" movies are not on a configured streaming provider anymore and add them back to monitored state:

```
$ excludarr check
      ╷
  ID  │ Title
 ═════╪════════════════════════════════════════════
  33  │ Iron Man
  35  │ Candyman
  36  │ Avatar
  37  │ The Avengers
  39  │ Skyfall
  41  │ Iron Man 3
      ╵
Are you sure you want to change the status of the movies back to monitored? (y/N) y
Succesfully changed the movies in Radarr to Monitored
```

Use the `--help` flag to get more information.

### Docker
To use this setup using Docker, you can use the `haijeploeg/excludarr` container. You can use the following environment variables:

Variable | Default | Description
--- | --- | ---
GENERAL_COUNTRY | NL | The two letter country code
GENERAL_PROVIDERS | netflix | Comma seperated list of providers. e.g. `GENERAL_PROVIDERS=netflix, amazon prime video`
TMDB_API_KEY | secret | Your TMDB API key
RADARR_URL | http://localhost:7878 | The Radarr URL
RADARR_API_KEY | secret | Your Radarr API Key
RADARR_VERIFY_SSL | false | To enable SSL verify, can be `true` or `false`
SONARR_URL | http://localhost:8989 | The Sonarr URL
SONARR_API_KEY | secret | Your Sonarr API Key
SONARR_VERIFY_SSL | false | To enable SSL verify, can be `true` or `false`

You can put those variables in a env file (e.g. `excludarr.env`) and use it in a command (recommended way). Look the `docker_example.env` for an example. If you have set your variables properly, you can execute excludarr in docker by just adding the command and paramaters at the end of the docker command. Example:

```bash
docker run -it --rm --env-file excludarr.env haijeploeg/excludarr:latest exclude -a delete
```

# Development
This library is still being developed. pytmdb and pyradarr will later be seperate modules.
